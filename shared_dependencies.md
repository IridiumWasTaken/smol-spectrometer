Shared Dependencies:

1. Spectrometer API: This is the main dependency that all files will share as it is the interface to the spectrometer.

2. Spectrometer Interface: The "spectrometer_interface.h" and "spectrometer_interface.cpp" files will contain the class and methods to interact with the spectrometer. These methods will be used by "main.cpp", "recording_settings.cpp", "spectra_reader.cpp", "spectra_display.cpp", and "spectra_saver.cpp".

3. Recording Settings: The "recording_settings.h" and "recording_settings.cpp" files will contain the class and methods to set the recording settings of the spectrometer. These methods will be used by "main.cpp" and "spectrometer_interface.cpp".

4. Spectra Reader: The "spectra_reader.h" and "spectra_reader.cpp" files will contain the class and methods to read the measured spectra from the spectrometer. These methods will be used by "main.cpp", "spectrometer_interface.cpp", and "spectra_display.cpp".

5. Spectra Display: The "spectra_display.h" and "spectra_display.cpp" files will contain the class and methods to display the read spectra. These methods will be used by "main.cpp" and "spectra_reader.cpp".

6. Spectra Saver: The "spectra_saver.h" and "spectra_saver.cpp" files will contain the class and methods to save the read spectra. These methods will be used by "main.cpp" and "spectra_reader.cpp".

7. Main: The "main.cpp" file will use methods from all other files to run the application.

8. Data Schemas: The data schemas for the spectra and recording settings will be shared across all files.

9. Function Names: The function names for interacting with the spectrometer, setting recording settings, reading spectra, displaying spectra, and saving spectra will be shared across all files.
